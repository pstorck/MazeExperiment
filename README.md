# Maze Experiment # 

### Summary ###
This is a side project written in Java that can create mazes of any given 
width and height and then solve them using Breadth First Search,
DepthFirst Search and A* Search algorithms. Originally, the maze creation and search
algorithms were all written recursively. They are now all written iteratively to 
prevent stack overflow errors when the maze size gets too large.

### How To Use ###
Editing and running the main method of the MazeGenerator class will display
the newly created maze in the console. Editing and running the main method
of the MazeDrawer class will create and solve the newly created maze using 
any/all of the search algorithms displayed on a JFrame window.


### What I Learned ###
- Recursive and Iterative algorithms for Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, A* Search and for generating a maze
- Graphics in Java using JFrame, JPanel, and AWT
